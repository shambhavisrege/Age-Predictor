# Age-Predictor
An interesting question is predicting how long as a person been in the workforce, where the age of the user answers this question. LinkedIn provides a lot of information about a person such as the positions they held, the seniority in these positions, their education and the dates when they graduated. This information can be used to approximate a person's age. In the industry ground truth data is not available in a lot of cases. Ground Truth data needs to be created in order to train and evaluate machine learning models that can perform the task of predicting the age of a person from these features. This project addresses this problem. Ground Truth has been established for a half of the data using it as the training data and the other half of the data has been used as the test data. The exploratory analysis of the data and the modeling has been performed in the Python Notebook and the steps have been listed down in the report.
